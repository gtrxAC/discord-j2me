    // Translation notes:
    // - Any line that begins with a "//" is a comment and is ignored.
    //   In this file, comments are used for explaining each string.
    // - Write your translated string inside the two quotation marks.
    // - If you need to use a quotation mark inside any of your translated
    //   strings, write it as \" instead.
    // - If the original string has any special formatting
    //   (e.g. space at the beginning or end), keep the formatting the same.
    // - If you want the English text to be shown for a specific string,
    //   replace the string with null (without any quotation marks).
    // - For any Discord-specific terminology (e.g. servers), use the same
    //   translated term that Discord officially uses for your language.

    // Notes about softkey command labels:
    // - Each softkey label has two variations, a short and a long one.
    // - In this translation file, the short labels are listed above the long ones.
    // - Short labels are used in places where there is limited screen space.
    // - Keep short labels as short as possible, ideally below 10 characters.
    //   If needed, you may use abbreviations.
    // - If a long label is short enough to where it could be used as a
    //   short label, use the same string for both labels.
